### Introduce Yourself
I am a Sophomore at Harcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur, pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology.

I am interested in Development in general. I am learning Android Development as of now, but I aim to get my hands dirty with Web Dev stuff, some AI/ML stuff and maybe with the Cyber Security thing.

Being fascinated by the wonders Open Source can lead to, I am also an Open Source Enthusiast!

I am a person who often loves using CLI over GUI (Maybe I'm evolving backwards :-) )

### Tech Stack I use
JAVA, Android Studio, C, HTML, CSS

### How did I discover Zoop?
Zip Zap Zoop,

I found it through a group. (wow that rhymes :P)
